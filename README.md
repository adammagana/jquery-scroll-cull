##Description
**Author**: Adam Magaña &lt;holla@adammagana.com&gt;
**Last Edit**: August 23, 2012
**Version**: 0.0.1

Based on the concept of [back-face culling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back-face_culling). Provides the ability to monitor a content area's scrollTop property and invoke a callback function for rendering new content when the scroll position is at or near the fold. This prevents content from being rendered that is not in the viewable scroll area.
